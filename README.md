<h1>Amazon EC2 and Auto Scaling</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project demonstrates the deployment and management of amazon EC2 instances, including configuring auto-scaling to ensure application reliability and cost efficiency. It covers key aspects of launching, resizing, monitoring, and managing EC2 instances in a cloud environment.
<br></br>
<b>Key Features:</b>

- <b>Instance Deployment:</b> Created and configured EC2 instances using the AWS Management Console.
- <b>Auto-Scaling Configuration:</b> Implemented scaling policies to automatically adjust compute resources based on demand.
- <b>Monitoring and Logging:</b> Utilized Amazon CloudWatch to track performance metrics and automate alerts.
- <b>Security Group Setup:</b> Configured firewall rules to manage inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances.
<br></br>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

- <b>Amazon EC2</b>
- <b>AWS Auto Scaling</b>
- <b>Amazon CloudWatch</b>
- <b>AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)</b>
<br></br>

<h2>Environments Used</h2>

- <b>AWS Management Console</b>
<br></br>
